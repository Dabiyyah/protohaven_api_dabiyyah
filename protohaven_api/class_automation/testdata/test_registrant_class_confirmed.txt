Hi Test,

Get excited! Your class Class Name has 4 total students, and will be running on February 20

We still have 2 seats left, so invite your friends!

Please remember to wear appropriate clothing for the activity - this usually means close-toed shoes, with any long sleeves or hair pulled back.

If you have any questions, please reach out to education@protohaven.org.

Hope to see you in the shop soon!
- Protohaven Staff
